# Coffee maker

<p align="center"><img src="../coffee-maker.gif" width="520" alt="Coffee maker card"></p>

Three illustrations, chosen with `style`: `filtre` (drip coffee maker with glass carafe, default), `dosette` (pod machine: Senseo, Nespresso, Dolce Gusto…) or `expresso` (bean-to-cup espresso machine).

- **Brewing** (power above `threshold`, 300 W by default): coffee drips or flows, the carafe or cup fills up, the water tank empties, steam rises, the buttons blink and the display shows `BREW` (`CAFE` in French).
- **Keeping warm** (drip only, between `warm_threshold` — 5 W by default — and `threshold`): the hot plate glows and the full carafe steams.
- **Ready** (pods / espresso, same power range): green LEDs, display `READY`.
- Designed for a smart plug (power + energy). If your keep-warm plate draws more than 300 W, raise `threshold`.
