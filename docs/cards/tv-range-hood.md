# Flat TV and range hood

<p align="center"><img src="../tv-range-hood.gif" width="560" alt="TV and range hood cards"></p>

**TV** (`custom:appliance-tv-card`): a flat screen, wall-mounted by default (nothing around it). `style: stand` puts it on a central stand, `style: feet` on two angled feet (also in the visual editor).

- **Switching on**: a bright line opens up the panel, light streaks converge into a start-up logo, then the streaming home screen appears; **switching off**: the picture collapses into a line, then a dot.
- **On**: a streaming home screen (featured banner, rows of tiles scrolling, moving selection). **Standby**: black screen, red LED. **Off**: black screen, no LED.
- With a smart plug: on above `threshold` (25 W), standby between `standby_threshold` (0.2 W) and 25 W, off below. With a `media_player`: `on` / `playing` / `paused` / `idle` = on, `standby` = standby, `off` = off, and the app or source is shown (« Allumée · Netflix »).

```yaml
type: custom:appliance-tv-card
entity: switch.tv_plug          # or media_player.living_room_tv
power: sensor.tv_plug_power
energy: sensor.tv_plug_energy_today
```

**Range hood** (`custom:appliance-range-hood-card`): chimney hood above a cooktop and a steaming pot.
- **Fan running**: the fan spins, steam from the pot is drawn up into the hood, air flows upwards; faster at high speed, with the speed LEDs.
- **Lights**: the lamps light up the cooktop. With a power sensor alone, a few watts (above `light_threshold`, 3 W) without the motor = « Lights only »; or set a `light` entity.
- Speeds from power (above `threshold` 40 W = low, above `high_threshold` 130 W = high) or from a `speed` entity.

```yaml
type: custom:appliance-range-hood-card
power: sensor.hood_power
light: light.hood_light         # optional
```
